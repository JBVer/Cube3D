## 💡 About the project

🛠️ 2 Team Members 

🚀 Cub3D is our joint project as students at School 42 in Paris. Inspired by the legendary Wolfenstein 3D, which pioneered the first-person shooter genre, we embarked on a thrilling journey into ray-casting. Through this project, we delved into the world of 3D graphics using the miniLibX library provided by our school. It was an opportunity to apply our coding skills, explore math's practical applications, and learn about game development hands-on.
We encourage you to take a look at the original Wolfenstein 3D before playing.
