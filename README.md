## ðŸ’¡ About the project
* Cub3D represents the collaborative effort of 2 students from the School 42 in Paris. Inspired by the iconic Wolfenstein 3D, the project introduced us to the world of ray-casting and 3D graphics. One unique aspect of our project is that it's designed to run exclusively within the school environment, utilizing the miniLibX library provided by our institution.
While this restriction limits external accessibility, it served as an excellent platform for honing our coding skills, experimenting with mathematics, and gaining hands-on experience in game development. Although our project may not be accessible beyond school premises, it remains a valuable learning experience.
